# Patterns

## Creational patterns

### Abstract Factory

Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent
objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### Factory Method

Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide
which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer
instantiation to subclasses.

### Abstract Factory VS Factory Method

The main difference between a "factory method" and an "abstract factory"
is that the factory method is a single method, and an abstract factory
is an object.

## Behavioral patterns

### Strategy

Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them
interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from
clients that use it.
